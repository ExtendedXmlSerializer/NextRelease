Welcome to ExtendedXmlSerializer's source repository, our little home on
the webternets for ExtendedXmlSerializer. Please have a look around. If
you have a question about our serializer, please do not hesitate to post
a question in our issues:

<https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/issues/new/>

We will mark it as a question/discussion and talk it through with you
using sample code. This process is currently being used to fill in the
gaps with our documentation, which could use a little love.

Additionally, please make use of our documentation tag seen here:

<https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3ADocumentation>

You can see the history of questions asked that we feel could eventually
be added to our documentation. We'll eventually get to it, we swear. ðŸ˜†

For now, you can continue by [reading our FAQs](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/wiki/01.-FAQs) or [learning some basics](https://github.com/ExtendedXmlSerializer/ExtendedXmlSerializer/wiki/02.-The-Basics).

Everything in ExtendedXmlSerializer begins with a configuration
container, from which you can use to configure the serializer and
ultimately create it:

``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer()
                                                // Configure...
                                                .Create();
```

Using this simple subject class:

``` csharp
    public sealed class Subject
    {
        public string Message { get; set; }
    
        public int Count { get; set; }
    }
```

The results of the default serializer will look like this:

``` xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Subject xmlns="clr-namespace:ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples.Introduction;assembly=ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples">
      <Message>Hello World!</Message>
      <Count>6776</Count>
    </Subject>
```

We can take this a step further by configuring the `Subject`'s `Type` and
`Member` properties, which will effect how its Xml is emitted. Here is an
example of configuring the `Subject`'s element name to emit as
`ModifiedSubject`:


``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().ConfigureType<Subject>()
                                                                    .Name("ModifiedSubject")
                                                                    .Create();
```

``` xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ModifiedSubject xmlns="clr-namespace:ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples.Introduction;assembly=ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples">
      <Message>Hello World!</Message>
      <Count>6776</Count>
    </ModifiedSubject>
```

Diving a bit further, we can also configure the type's member
information. For example, configuring `Subject.Message` to emit as `Text`
instead:

``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().ConfigureType<Subject>()
                                                                    .Member(x => x.Message)
                                                                    .Name("Text")
                                                                    .Create();

```

``` xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Subject xmlns="clr-namespace:ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples.Introduction;assembly=ExtendedXmlSerializer.Samples">
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
      <Count>6776</Count>
    </Subject>
```

## Xml Settings

In case you want to configure the XML write and read settings via
`XmlWriterSettings` and `XmlReaderSettings` respectively, you can do that
via extension methods created for you to do so:

``` csharp
    Subject subject = new Subject{ Count = 6776, Message = "Hello World!" };
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().Create();
    string contents = serializer.Serialize(new XmlWriterSettings {Indent = true}, subject);
    // ...
```

And for reading:

``` csharp
    Subject instance = serializer.Deserialize<Subject>(new XmlReaderSettings{IgnoreWhitespace = false}, contents);
    // ...
```

## Serialization

Now that your configuration container has been configured and your
serializer has been created, it's time to get to the serialization.

``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().Create();
    TestClass obj = new TestClass();
    string xml = serializer.Serialize(obj);
```

## Deserialization

``` csharp
    TestClass obj2 = serializer.Deserialize<TestClass>(xml);
```


## Classic Serialization/Deserialization Patterns

Most of the code examples that you see in this documentation make use of
useful extension methods that make serialization and deserialization a
snap with ExtendedXmlSerializer.  However, if you would like to break down 
into the basic, classical pattern of serialization, and deserialization, 
this is supported too, as seen by the following examples.  Here's serialization:

``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().Create();
    TestClass              instance   = new TestClass();
    MemoryStream           stream     = new MemoryStream();
    using (XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(stream))
    {
        serializer.Serialize(writer, instance);
        writer.Flush();
    }

    stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    string contents = new StreamReader(stream).ReadToEnd();
```

And here's how to deserialize:

``` csharp
    TestClass deserialized;
    MemoryStream contentStream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(contents));
    using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(contentStream))
    {
        deserialized = (TestClass)serializer.Deserialize(reader);
    }
```

### w/ Settings Overrides

Additionally, ExtendedXmlSerializer also supports overrides for
serialization and deserialization that allow you to pass in
`XmlWriterSettings` and `XmlReaderSettings` respectively. Here's an example
of this for serialization:

``` csharp
    IExtendedXmlSerializer serializer = new ConfigurationContainer().Create();
    TestClass              instance   = new TestClass();
    MemoryStream           stream     = new MemoryStream();
    
    string contents = serializer.Serialize(new XmlWriterSettings { /* ... */ }, stream, instance);
```

And for deserialization:

``` csharp
    MemoryStream contentStream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(contents));
    TestClass deserialized = serializer.Deserialize<TestClass>(new XmlReaderSettings{ /* ... */ }, contentStream);
```
